## 📊 **Technical Implementation**

### **Backend Activity Logging:**
```python
def log_activity(username, activity_type, title, description, icon="system", badge="info"):
    # Creates timestamped activity record
    # Stores in user data with unique ID
    # Maintains last 20 activities per user
    # Auto-calculates time_ago display
```

### **Activity Data Structure:**
```python
activity = {
    "id": "uuid",
    "type": "rule_created",
    "title": "Rule Created", 
    "description": "Created new automation rule 'High ROAS' with $75 payout",
    "icon": "rule",
    "badge": "success",
    "timestamp": "2024-07-10T15:30:00",
    "time_ago": "5 min ago"
}
```

### **Frontend Dynamic Loading:**
```javascript
// Loads activities via API
// Renders with proper icons and badges
// Shows empty state when no activities
// Updates timestamps dynamically
```

## 🚀 **User Experience Improvements**

   - Editing rule settings (payout, thresholds, etc.)
   - Deleting automation rule
   - Assigning rule to campaign

2. **Automation Actions:**
